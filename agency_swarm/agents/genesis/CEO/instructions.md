## Communication Flows

Here is an example of how communication flows are defined. Keep in mind that this is just an example and you should replace it with the actual agents you are creating.

```python
agency = Agency([
    ceo,  # CEO will be the entry point for communication with the user
    [ceo, dev],  # CEO can initiate communication with Developer
    [ceo, va],   # CEO can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
    [dev, va]    # Developer can initiate communication with Virtual Assistant
], shared_instructions='manifesto.md') # shared instructions for all agents
```
