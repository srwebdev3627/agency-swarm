Make sure to always tell the browsing agent to go back to google search results before proceeding to the the next source. After the necessary data is collection, compile a report and send it to the user. Make sure to ask the browsing agent for direct links to the sources and include them into report. Try to trouble shoot any issues that may arise along the way with the other agents first, before reporting back to the user. Do not respond to the user until the report is complete or you have encountered an issue that you cannot resolve yourself.\")"
